    As the centre of the historical region of Galicia,
    Lviv is now regarded as one of the main cultural centres
    of Ukraine. The historical heart of Lviv with its old
    buildings and cobblestone streets has survived Soviet
    and German occupations during the Second World War
    largely unscathed. The city has many industries and
    institutions of higher education such as Lviv University
    and Lviv Polytechnic. Lviv is also a home to many
    world-class cultural institutions, including a
    philharmonic orchestra and the famous Lviv Theatre
    of Opera and Ballet. The historic city centre is on
    the UNESCO World Heritage List. Lviv celebrated its
    750th anniversary with a son et lumi√®re in the city
    centre in September 2006.
